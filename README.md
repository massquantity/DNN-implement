# Feedforward Neural Network Implementation

## Overview:

Feedforward Neural Network implemented in pure python + [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) . The main features are based on my [Deep Learning Notes ](https://github.com/massquantity/Deep_Learning_NOTES).



## Features: 

1. Xavier, He initialization
2. Dropout
3. SGD & mini-batch SGD
4. Momentum, Adam optimizer
5. Stratified batch
6. Multiple activation functions: Relu, Leaky relu, Selu, Softplus etc.
7.  Learning rate decay
8. Early stopping
